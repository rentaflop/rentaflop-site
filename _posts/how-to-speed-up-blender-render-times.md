## Optimize Your Scene

* **Simplify Geometry**: Reduce the complexity of your scene by optimizing the geometry. Remove unnecessary details, simplify meshes, and use level-of-detail (LOD)
techniques where applicable. [Reducing the number of subdiv levels](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/subdivision_surface.html)
and polygon counts where possible also helps a lot.
* **Limit Particle Systems**: Particle systems can significantly impact render times. Consider reducing the number of particles, using simpler physics settings, or
use simpler particle types to speed up rendering.
* **Optimize Materials**: Simplify and optimize your materials by reducing unnecessary nodes, shaders, and textures.
* **Texture optimizations**: Large or high-resolution textures can consume memory and increase render times. Resize or optimize textures to the necessary resolution
without compromising too much visual quality.

## Tweak Your Lighting Setup

* **Use Efficient Lighting**: Choose lighting setups that provide sufficient illumination while minimizing complexity. Utilize area lights or environment
lighting techniques like HDRI maps for realistic results. Consider using fewer light sources.
* **Use Efficient Shaders**: Complex shader networks can slow down rendering. Simplify and optimize your materials by using simpler shaders.
* **Disable Ambient Occlusion**: Ambient occlusion is a shading technique used to simulate the soft shadows or darkening that occurs in crevices and areas where objects
are close to each other. By disabling ambient occlusion, you eliminate the need for Blender to calculate and simulate the interaction of ambient light with
the scene geometry. This reduces the overall number of calculations performed during rendering, resulting in faster render times. If the scene doesn't heavily
rely on the visual benefits of ambient occlusion, disabling it can be a viable option to accelerate the rendering process.
* **Modify Clamp Values**: Lowering the clamp values can help speed up renders by reducing the amount of noise caused by bright or extreme light samples.
The clamp values control the maximum brightness allowed for each pixel during rendering. When bright areas are clamped, fewer additional samples are required
to accurately render them, allowing the renderer to converge to an accurate image faster. However, it's important to note that lowering clamp values can also
affect the overall appearance of the render. It can potentially lead to loss of detail in very bright areas or cause them to appear dull or less realistic.
* **Avoid Excessive Ray Tracing**: Excessive ray tracing, such as multiple bounces or glossy reflections, can significantly increase render times. Use the minimum required settings to achieve the desired visual quality. These techniques can increase the photorealism of a scene, but having too many light bounces or similar
scenarios can drastically increase the amount of ray tracing computation, and thus time, required for rendering.

## Pre-compute Scene Elements

* **Caching Physics Simulations**: Blender offers various physics simulations like cloth, fluid, and smoke. These simulations can be computationally expensive and
time-consuming to calculate during each frame of the rendering process. By caching the simulation data, you can precalculate the results and reuse them across
multiple frames, reducing the need for real-time calculations.
* **Enable Persistent Data**: Similar to caching, enabling persistent data in Blender can speed up renders by reusing previously calculated data across multiple
frames in an animation. By reusing persistent data, Blender only needs to calculate the changes between frames, rather than starting the calculations from scratch
for each frame. This optimization is particularly effective for animation sequences where the scene geometry, lighting, and camera positions remain relatively
consistent across frames. It's important to note that persistent data requires additional memory to store the cached information. 
* **Baking Lighting and Shadows**: Baking lighting and shadows into textures or lightmaps can drastically reduce render times, especially for scenes with complex
lighting setups or intricate shadow interactions. By baking these elements, you convert them into textures that can be directly applied to objects, eliminating the
need for real-time light calculations during rendering.
* **Baking Textures**: Complex material textures, such as procedural or dynamic textures, can increase render times significantly. By baking these textures into image
files, you capture their appearance at a specific point in time and apply them as precalculated images during rendering. This reduces the need for complex
texture calculations, resulting in faster renders.

## Post-Processing Optimization

* **Optimize Compositing**: Review your compositing nodes and ensure you are using them efficiently. Remove unnecessary nodes or consolidate them to minimize
processing time.
* **Render Passes**: Utilize [render passes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/layers/passes.html) to separate different components of your
scene, allowing you to make adjustments or apply effects more efficiently in post-processing.

## Adjust Your Render Settings

* **Lower Image Resolution**: Lowering the image resolution can significantly reduce Blender render times due to the reduction in the number of pixels that need to be
processed and rendered. When you lower the resolution of your render, you effectively decrease the total number of pixels in the final image, which reduces the
computational workload required for rendering. Lowering the resolution too much may result in a noticeable loss of detail and overall image quality, so
it's important to strike a balance between resolution and visual quality.
* **Optimize Sampling**: Another way to speed up Blender render times is to reduce the number of samples used in your render. Samples are essentially the number
of times Blender calculates the lighting and shading in your scene. While more samples can result in a smoother and more realistic render, they also significantly
increase render times. Consider using adaptive sampling or denoising techniques to reduce the required number of samples efficiently. Denoising is a technique that
can significantly reduce render times while maintaining the quality of your image. It works by removing noise or grain from
your render, which is often caused by low sample rates or other factors. Blender has a built-in
[denoising feature](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/render/cycles/settings/scene/render_layers/denoising.html) that can be accessed in the Render
Layers tab. Simply enable the Denoising checkbox and adjust the settings to your liking. Keep in mind that denoising can sometimes result in a loss of detail,
so itâ€™s important to experiment with different settings to find the right balance between speed and quality.
* **Optimize Animations**: Unlike a still image, not every frame in an animation needs to be high resolution with many samples. This is because the viewer only
sees each frame for a fraction of a second, which isn't enough time to notice the small loss of detail associated with lower resolution and noisier images.
In some cases, you can even reduce the number of frames per second to limit the amount of rendering to be done. For instance, if you're using 30 fps, try lowering
to the standard (for many things) 24 fps.
Lowering these settings in animations can result in a significant speed boost in rendering.
* **Adjust Tile Size**: Experiment with different tile sizes to find the optimal balance between performance and memory usage. Larger tile sizes generally
perform better, especially when using GPU rendering.
* **Use GPU Rendering**: One of the most effective ways to speed up Blender render times is to use GPU rendering instead of CPU rendering.
GPUs are designed to handle complex calculations and graphics processing, making them much faster than CPUs for rendering tasks.
To use GPU rendering in Blender, you'll need a compatible graphics card and
to [enable GPU rendering in Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.html).
Once set up, you should see a significant improvement in render times,
[sometimes 5-10x faster](https://techgage.com/article/blender-2-93-performance-best-cpus-gpus/). Not all projects are suitable for
GPU rendering, so be sure to test your settings before committing to a full render.
* **Choose Your Render Engine Carefully**: Your render engine choice can have a significant impact on render times. Blender offers two primary rendering engines: Cycles and Eevee. Each engine has its own strengths and considerations when it comes to rendering speed. However, the two engines result in a very
different feel for your project, so it's important to carefully consider which one to use.

Cycles Render Engine: Cycles is a physically-based ray-tracing engine in Blender known for its high-quality output. It calculates light paths, reflections,
refractions, and shadows accurately, which can result in photorealistic renders. However, this level of realism comes at the cost of longer render times,
especially for complex scenes.

Eevee Render Engine: Eevee is a real-time rendering engine in Blender designed for quick previewing and interactive workflows. It sacrifices some realism
in favor of faster rendering times. Use Eevee for non-photorealistic renders. If achieving a photorealistic look is not crucial for your project, utilizing
Eevee can significantly reduce render times. Note that NVIDIA GPUs tend to work exceptionally well with Blender's Cycles rendering engine,
providing excellent performance boosts, while support for multi-GPU rendering for Eevee does not yet exist.

## Use a Render Farm

* **Network Rendering**: If you have access to multiple machines, you can set up network rendering within Blender to distribute the rendering workload across your
local network to create your own render farm. Check out this excellent tutorial on
[setting up your own Blender render farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU5VNhf0jFI) using CrowdRender.
* **Use a Cloud Render Farm**: For large-scale or time-critical projects, consider using a render farm service that distributes the rendering workload across
multiple machines. Similar to using personally-owned GPUs, utilizing hundreds of GPUs at a render farm can speed up render times greatly. Blender render farms such
as rentaflop complete weeks-long projects in a matter of hours. Using a cloud rendering service is one of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce your render
