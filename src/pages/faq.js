             their creations, rather than looking up Nvidia hardware specs. Our affordable prices allow you to render animations without breaking the bank, especially
             important for experimentation and meeting deadlines. With rentaflop rendering, you don't have to sacrifice on quality.

    answer: <>
	      To use rentaflop rendering, you must first create an account and add <RentaflopLink href={portal_url+"/payment"} color="info.main">add payment info</RentaflopLink>.
	      When you submit a rendering, you'll be charged according to the amount of computing power used to complete the rendering.
	      We use Octane benchmarking to calculate a score for each graphics card on the rentaflop network and bill in minute increments
	      on each device used to render your workload. At the end of each month, your payment method will be charged for the entire month's
	      usage.
