             important for experimentation and meeting deadlines. With rentaflop rendering, you don't have to sacrifice on quality.

  {
    question: `How does billing work?`,
    answer: <>
	      To use rentaflop rendering, you must first create an account and add <RentaflopLink href={portal_url+"/payment"} color="info.main" target="_blank">payment info</RentaflopLink>.
	      When you submit a rendering, you'll be charged immediately based on the exact price quoted by our price calculator.
	      Our price calculator estimates the amount of computing power it would take to complete the rendering and shows you the corresponding price.
	      We use Octane benchmarking to calculate a score for each graphics card on the rentaflop network and bill in minute increments
	      for each device used to render your workload.
	      Once you initiate the render, we process your payment for the amount quoted by the price calculator, and then we fully render your project.
	    </>
